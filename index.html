        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 text-left">
            This is a great idea passed on by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TizzyEnt" target="_blank">@TizzyEnt</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morgonforthepeople" target="_blank">@MorganForThePeople</a>.  I wanted to make this as easy as possible for people to do.  
        I have created a PDF that you can fill out and send to the IRS. It is prefilled with the accurate "The Heritedge Foundation" information.  She had already looked up the person to report (<a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/john-p-backiel">John P. Backiel</a>)
        and the address and I verified it all.  There is even a version below with the entire complaint you just have to add your info and email it (from your email) to <a href="mailto:eoclass@irs.gov">eoclass@irs.gov</a>
        
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 text-center">

                Filled out PDF (just needs your name and to be emailed by you to the IRS)
            </a>

            <a href="https://contractorwolf.github.io/for-our-democracy-I-dissent/f13909_partial.pdf" target="_blank">
                original PDF with The Heritedge Foundation details but no description (add your own or use the GPT below)
            </a>
            If you want to go deeper you can use a simple (free) Custom GPT I created that will re-write the complaint description for you, so they arent all the same descriptions.

            You cant use exactly what the girl said to write in or you can use me custom GPT that will hand-write the complaint for you.  
            I hope this helps you to take action against the corruption of the GOP in our government.  
            <br>
            Please share this with as many people as possible.  We need to take action to save our democracy.
