    <p>
        This is a great idea passed on by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TizzyEnt" target="_blank">@TizzyEnt</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morgonforthepeople" target="_blank">@MorganForThePeople</a>.  I wanted to make this as easy as possible for people to do.  
        I have created a PDF that you can fill out and send to the IRS. It is prefilled with the accurate "The Heritedge Foundation" information.  She had already looked up the person to report (<a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/john-p-backiel">John P. Backiel</a>)
        and the address and I verified it all.  There is even a version below with the entire complaint you just have to add your info and email it (from your email) to <a href="mailto:eoclass@irs.gov">eoclass@irs.gov</a>
        <br>  
        <br>

        <a href="https://contractorwolf.github.io/for-our-democracy-I-dissent/f13909_complete.pdf" target="_blank">
            Filled out PDF (just needs your name and to be emailed by you to the IRS)
        </a>
        <br>  
        <a href="https://contractorwolf.github.io/for-our-democracy-I-dissent/f13909_partial.pdf" target="_blank">
            original PDF with The Heritedge Foundation details but no description (add your own or use the GPT below)
        </a>
        If you want to go deeper you can use a simple (free) Custom GPT I created that will re-write the complaint description for you, so they arent all the same descriptions.

            GPT to hand-write the complaint
        </a>    
        
        You cant use exactly what the girl said to write in or you can use me custom GPT that will hand-write the complaint for you.  
        I hope this helps you to take action against the corruption of the GOP in our government.  
        <br>
        Please share this with as many people as possible.  We need to take action to save our democracy.
